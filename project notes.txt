npm i cors allows frontend to access backend api

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json("Hello from backend");
});
defines a route handler for a GET request to the root URL ("/") of your Express.js application.

Here's what each part does:

app.get("/"): This sets up a route handler for HTTP GET requests to the root URL ("/") of your Express application.
(req, res) => { ... }: This is an arrow function that defines the behavior of the route handler.
 It takes two parameters: req (the request object) and res (the response object).
res.json("Hello from backend"): This sends a JSON response with the string "Hello from backend". 
The json() method of the response object converts the provided JavaScript object or value into JSON format and sends it as the response body.
So, when a GET request is made to the root URL of your Express application (e.g., http://localhost:8081/),
 the server will respond with the JSON string "Hello from backend".
  This route handler is useful for testing your server setup and verifying that it's functioning correctly.

  ///// front end notes

  file architecture: scenes folder is based on the page that you are working on i.e. scenes/dashboard/index.jsx represents everything on the dashboard page
  //theme.js
  theme.js file to setup colours and typography of the website
  taliwind shades extension to easily make lighter shades of colours

  //app.js
  app div within colourmodecontext.provider to give gloabl access to colourcontext.
  also put app within theme provider to give material ui access as well

  //Topbar.jsx
   <Box display="flex"
             backgroundColor={colours.primary[400]}
             borderRadius="3px">
  The colors.primary used rather than material ui theme because rather than just the main colours 
   primary:{
                    main: colours.primary[100],
                },
                secondary:{
                    main:colours.greenAccent[500],
                },
                neutral: {
                    dark: colours.grey[700],
                    main: colours.grey[500],
                    light: colours.grey[100]
                },
                background:{
                    default:"#fcfcfc",
                },
                 we can use more shades if we ever need them
 <InputBase sx={{ml:2, flex:1}} placeholder="Search"/> this builds the search bar
 note how input base uses sx to define css, whereas box doesn't. also ml means margin left.
